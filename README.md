# United-States-Sales-Data
I've created a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to analyze sales data across the United States, providing actionable insights for businesses of all sizes.

Key Features:

Hierarchical Chart: Drill down into sales data by region, state, and city.
Interactive Map: Visualize sales performance across the country.
Line Charts: Analyze sales trends over time.
Binning: Group sales data into categories for easier analysis.
Column Charts: Compare sales across different regions and states.


By leveraging these visualizations, you can:

Identify high-performing regions and target markets.
Analyze seasonal trends and fluctuations in sales.
Optimize sales strategies and resource allocation.
